This project shows a sample website created by Steven Tran of his skills, classes taken at WPI, and class year.

## Technical Achievements
- **Styled page with CSS**: Added rules for the p, body, img, li, table, h1, and h2 selectors along with my own custom classes. 
Used color, margin, font-family, text-align, text-decoration, and width.

- **Added a simple JS animation**: Webpage flashes between black and a grey color.

- **Added other HTML Tags**: Used table to list my CS courses side by side, used img to add an avatar of myself, used link to add my fonts 
from Google fonts, used span to separate my name and underline it with CSS, and used the a tag to link the WPI CS and DS department websites.

### Design Achievements
- **Used three fonts from Google Fonts**: I used Merriweather as the font for the primary text in my site, Sacramento as my h1, and 
Montserrat for my labels.
- **Used an Adobe color pallette***: I used an Adobe color pallette (screenshot on GitHub)
